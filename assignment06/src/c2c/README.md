# Latency Assignment

## 1. Compile and run

* For the part of `c2c`, you can check the arguments in the code. Without specifying arguments, the test will take the default; otherwise, you can specify, e.g.,
```bash
./c2c 20 30 0
```
The output in this code can be written into the file as you want. To do this, you can check the util function with the comment. Feel free to modify it for a more beautiful output format.

## 2. Plot the results

CI is not used in this assignment. Use the Python script as a guide for the result figures. Feel free to modify these scripts to plot it (in /util).

* Generating graphs for `c2c`,
```bash
python3 generate_chart_c2c.py reference_output_c2c.csv
```
